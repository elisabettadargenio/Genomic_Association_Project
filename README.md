# Genomic Association Project
The purpose of the project is to look for associations between genetic variations - known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) - and a complex disease
(phenotype): nicotine addiction. These types of studies are know as Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). <br />
To overcome the statistical gaps in the classic GWAS analyses, this paper presents different statistical methods than those usually used, also introducing methods for high-dimensional data developed for other contexts, but which also find application in genomic data. <br />
It shows the application of a model that follows the typically used one, the univariate model, but with corrections to resolve some of the statistical deficits, and then of multivariate logistic models with regularization methods of the lasso type, elastic net and fused lasso. <br />

Data are directly downloaded in rnsps.r script through the rsnps package.
